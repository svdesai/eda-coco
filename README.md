## Exploratory Data Analysis on MS COCO style datasets.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This repo mainly contains a jupyter notebook in which some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on MS COCO. While EDA is widely used for categorical data, I haven't seen a lot of repos doing EDA for object detection datasets, which is the reason I created this repo.

### Contents:
 - eda_coco_style.ipynb 
 - coco_train2017.html  (EDA results on MS COCO 2017 - train)
 - voc2012.html  (EDA results on VOC 2012)

###  Features:
- Some basic high level statistics
- Distribution of objects across images
- Class wise distribution of objects
- Observing average bounding box sizes for each class
- Viewing random images

### Notes:

Used [this tool ](https://github.com/yukkyo/voc2coco) to convert PASCAL VOC XML style datasets to MS COCO style JSONs. 

### Maintainers:

This tool is developed and maintained by [Vikas Desai](https://svdesai.github.io) (me).
